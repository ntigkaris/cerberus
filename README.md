Lightweight security app

### 1. What is cerberus?

Cerberus is a Python-based security solution developed for *Windows Vista* and subsequent OS versions. It periodically keeps activity records by taking snapshots during user sessions. Its core functionality includes recording the contents of the user’s *Downloads* directory and capturing a *photo* of the individual operating the computer at one-hour intervals. This mechanism provides an additional layer of monitoring for machines that are not protected by user authentication or that are accessible in shared and public environments.
